- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Wadood Butt

I am a 2nd year computer science student, creating new projects and implementing new ideas
frequently. What I like most about coding is the freedom to make whatever I desire so long as
I am willing to grow from my mistakes and have a resilient mindset.

I hope you enjoy my display of my projects!
